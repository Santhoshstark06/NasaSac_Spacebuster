### Mars in relation to the Earth

Today, the Earthâ€™s sister planet Mars is very different from our home, but perhaps this was not always the case. Mars was once very similar to the Earth. Perhaps there was once life on Mars.

Today, Mars and the Earth are very different planets. Mars is smaller, covered by ice and dust and further away from the Sun than the Earth. Its surface temperature currently ranges from 20 degrees during the day to -140 degrees at night, and the planet is a sterile and hostile environment without water or an atmosphere. At the same time, the planet has no internal magnetic field to protect its surface against harmful particles from space. But this has not always been the case.
